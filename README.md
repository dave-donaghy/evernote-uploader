# evernote-uploader

Hoping to transfer a load of old stuff into Evernote, and it's currently stored as one directory,
with a name, containing an orderd set of images that form the pages of the document.

But there is no bulk uploader in Evernote that does this - dropping a set of files onto the docker
icon on a Mac, for example, will create a set of notes.  To be fair, that is a really handy thing to have.

Also, I like the "create" date to reflect the original date of the document, which for me is often a scanned
piece of paper: some of these are bills or invoice, and some are certificates, so the creation date
is a meaningful thing.

So I'd like to have the following features:

* The ability (just hinted at) to easily create a note with a name and multiple attachments.
* The ability to change the "created" date on a note t some arbitrary date, possibily in bulk.
